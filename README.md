# PokemonGoRaidBot
Discord Bot Template based on Discord.Net 1.0.1

This discord bot will parse posts in a discord guild and provide clean output to a configured channel on the discord guild.

It attempts to identify responses to a raid post and includes the chat on the configured channel's history as well.

It determines the end time of the raid and removes it from chat after the raid has ended.
